The Random Access Memory (RAM) is a crucial component in digital systems used for temporary data storage and retrieval during program execution. It allows data to be read from or written to any memory location in the same amount of time, hence the term “random access.”In this project, a RAM module was designed and simulated using the Cadence design and simulation environment. The design consists of an array of storage cells, address decoder, data input/output lines, and control signals such as Read/Write Enable and Chip Select. The RAM was implemented in Verilog HDL at the RTL level and verified through Cadence SimVision waveform analysis.The simulation confirmed correct data storage and retrieval for various input addresses and control signal combinations.
